<h1>Residency match timeline, application information, and preparation resources</h1>
<p>Are you applying for match residency? Want to know when you can apply for residency match? Or perhaps how to get a good match? Or even if everyone gets matched (unfortunately, no, but that’s why we’re here!) </p>
<p>In order to participate in the Match, you must satisfy all of the ACGME’s requirements which can be found here (this is a 55 page document, but don’t worry, we’ll cover the key components) including: 
    -graduation from a US or Canadian medical school accredited by the Liaison Comittee on Medical Education (LCME), or
    -graduation from an AOACOCA-accredited college of osteopathic medicine program in the US, or 
    -graduation from a medical school outside of the US or Canada and meeting one of the following: 
        -holding a valid ECFMG certificate, or
        -holding a full and unrestricted medical license in the US licensing jurisdiction in which the ACGME-accredited program is located
    </p>
<p> International medical graduates (IMG’s)
    International medical graduates (IMG’s) must pass all examinations required to obtain ECFMG certification including passing scores on the following: Step 1, Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK), and Step 2 Clinical Skills of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), and verification of the IMG’s final medical school diploma and transcript
    </p>
    <p>You must meet the requirements for ECFMG certification by the Rank Order List deadline in order to participate in the Match.</p>

    <p>The NRMP conducts weekly data exchanges with the ECFMG. These exchanges allow ECFMG to inform the NRMP that an applicant satisfies the requirements. These exchanges begin in September of the year you apply and continue until the Rank Order List Deadline (the following March)</p>
    <p>How do I apply? Applicants will apply online via the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) system. For IMG’s, the ECFMG will serve as the designated Dean’s office and assist with the MyERAS application process. 
        IMG’s begin the application process by requesting an ERAS token. The ERAS token is a unique id number from ECFMG that allows applicants to access the MyERAS site. On the MyERAS site, applicants can complete their residency applications, select programs to apply, and assign supporting documentation.
        </p>
    <p>As the designated Dean’s office for IMG’s, the ECFMG will receive supporting documentation for the MyERAS app (both from the applicant and medical school), transmit these docs to the applicant’s MyERAS application, and transmit the ECFMG status report. </p>
